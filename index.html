            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities
              of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the
              name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of
              darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost
              children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and
              furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers.
              And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance upon thee.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I like animals better than people sometimes... Especially dogs.
              Dogs are the best. Every time you come home, they act like they haven't
              seen you in a year. And the good thing about dogs... is they got different
              dogs for different people. Like pit bulls. The dog of dogs. Pit bull can
              be the right man's best friend... or the wrong man's worst enemy. You going
              to give me a dog for a pet, give me a pit bull. Give me... Raoul. Right,
              Omar? Give me Raoul.</p>

						<h3>We happy?</h3>
						<p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami.
              This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.
              Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes
              with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit. </p>
